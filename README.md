# Shipping-Calculator
The Shipping Calculator calculates the cost to ship an item
based on the location it is being sent to. The user inputs the
name of the item, if the item is fragile, the items cost, and 
the location the item is being sent to. The program will then
output the items information and total shipping cost to a 
text file.
